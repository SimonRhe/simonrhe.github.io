<h1>Why I chose static site generator Eleventy for my blog</h1>

<h2>Why use a static site generator</h2>
<!-- Excerpt Start -->
<p>I had worked hard to master HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript, and so when the time came to set up my personal blog, I was looking for a tool that would give me 100% control over the blog‚Äôs code. I wanted a tool that would allow me to <strong>keep the code clean, simple and lightning fast</strong>, while helping me <strong>automate the more mundane tasks</strong>.</p>
<!-- Excerpt End -->
<p>Specifically, I wanted to automate:</p>
<ul>
<li>creating an HTML file for each blog post</li>
<li>referencing the blog posts from the home page</li>
<li>categorizing the posts using tags</li>
<li>uploading the files to the server.</li>
</ul>
<p>My blog, for now at least, doesn‚Äôt need to access live databases, provide user sign in or other more advanced features, and so a <em>static site generator</em>‚Äî<strong>a piece of backend software that can combine text and Markdown files with HTML templates to produce static HTML pages</strong>‚Äîwas what I needed.</p>
<h2>Eleventy vs. other static site generators</h2>
<p>There are many static site generators out there: <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a>, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, and <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a> are the most popular. I ultimately settled on <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>, an up-and-coming static site generator started in 2017, for three main reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üëç" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/13.0.0/72x72/1f44d.png"/> Eleventy gives me <strong>100% control over the resulting HTML</strong> code and does not bloat it with libraries and structures that my simple blog site will not use</li>
<li><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üëç" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/13.0.0/72x72/1f44d.png"/> Eleventy is <strong>written in JavaScript</strong>‚Äîa language I know well‚Äîand runs on Node.js, which allows me to customize it easily and use existing JavaScript libraries to generate HTML pages</li>
<li><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üëç" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/13.0.0/72x72/1f44d.png"/> Eleventy is <strong>simple</strong>, so I don‚Äôt have to learn a new framework just to get my site going.</li>
</ol>
<p>As I started using Eleventy, however, I realized that there are also a few drawbacks to using it:</p>
<ul>
<li><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üëé" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/13.0.0/72x72/1f44e.png"/> There are relatively <strong>few existing templates</strong> that we can use when compared to other static site generators</li>
<li><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üëé" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/13.0.0/72x72/1f44e.png"/> The <strong>documentation is patchy</strong> at times and for some features, I found myself having to look at other people‚Äôs code on GitHub to figure out how Eleventy works.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nevertheless, although the learning curve was steeper than I expected, Eleventy does what it promises and it is easily extensible by using plugins made specifically for Eleventy, or calling JavaScript libraries.</p>
<p>In future posts, I‚Äôll run through how to set up a simple Eleventy site, and <a href="/posts/publishing-eleventy-site-github-pages/">how to automatically upload it to your GitHub user page</a> so you can get your own blog going.</p>
